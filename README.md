Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass, the client, required a system for training students in preparation for their driving tests.

What did you do particularly well?

I excelled in grasping the client's requirements and articulating them into well-defined system specifications.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would incorporate additional technical explanations while ensuring the content remains accessible and user-friendly for a non-technical audience.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's requirements were integrated into the system design, encompassing all the features discussed in the client interview. Prioritizing the user's needs is paramount, as their satisfaction determines the project's success or failure.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I adopt a user-centered and empathetic approach when designing software, prioritizing the user's needs. Effective software is crafted with the user as the top priority. I find that utilizing UML class, sequence, and activity diagrams is highly valuable for analyzing and designing systems.
